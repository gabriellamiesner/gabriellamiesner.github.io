  <p id = "about-text"> Gabriella is an 18 year old student at the University of Missouri, majoring in Information Technology, with a certificate in Web and Mobile Applications Development. She is involved with the <a href = "http://mca.missouri.edu/"class = "links"> Mizzou Computing Association</a>, where she helped to rebuild the website as a part of the Web Development Special Interest Group. Gabriella also leads the <a href = "https://github.com/MCA-Data-Science" class = "links"> Data Science</a> Special Interest Group, where she helps new data scientists learn the neccesary skills to analyze data and creates data visualizations with her team.
  <br>
  <br>
  She loves to create things with code, but how she fell into the wonderful world of technology is a bit atypical. When Gabriella was an avid reader in the sixth grade, she wanted to connect with other readers and talk about all the books she was reading. So she created a book blog, where she <i> did</i> connect with other readers and talk about books, but she also began to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ever since then, Gabriella has been learning and creating things with code in some capacity, even if the road there has been a little bit bumpy.</p>
