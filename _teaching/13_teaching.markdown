three interrelated changes in technology area:

1. the mobile digital platform composed of smartphones and tablet devices
2. the growing business use of big data, including the Internet of Things (IoT) driven by billions of data-producing sensors
3. the growth in cloud computing, by which more and more business software runs over the Internet.

there has been a new globalization - driven from information technology that has

- radically reduced the cost of moving goods + ideas to low wage countries
- led to the deindustrialization of wealthy countries

    - data management software: software governing the organization of data on physical storage media
    - networking and telecommunications technology : physical devices and software that link the various pieces of hardware and transfers data from one physical location to another
