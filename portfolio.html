The web application aims to improve the online learning experience. I contributed auto updating graphs for the website to mimic what assignment analytics would look like. I used python and matplotlib create the data visualizations, and created a python script to generate dummy student score data as we did not have any on hand. Neurosight won best survival hack at TechTogether New York.</p>

I also learned how to use the puppeteer library in JavaScript to web scrape all the classes off of the Missouri S & T and Mizzou websites.</p>
