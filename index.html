<h2 id = "stuff-ive-done"> 👩🏻‍💻 stuff i've done 💾 </h2>
<p> last summer, i attended a cool summer camp called <a href = "https://www.kodewithklossy.com/">kode with klossy</a>, where i learned a whole lot, made an mvp iOS app in swift, made some awesome friends, and began to see coding's true capabilities for social change. at my high school, i took a web programming class and learned the basics of html and css, but more importantly, got connected with some awesome folks at <a href = "https://www.slalom.com/home">slalom</a>. together, we began brainstorming, wireframing, and coding a web application that my high school's admission team is scheduled to begin using next fall. a little after kode with klossy, i applied to another awesome program at <a href = "https://www.launchcode.org/">launchcode</a> in st. louis, mo, called <a href = "https://www.launchcode.org/codergirl">codergirl</a>. after i was accepted into codergirl, i learned javascript and java, made some projects, attended many study sessions at the gelateria, and made some awesome friends. right now, i am enrolled in a cool eight week program through launchcode called liftoff, where i am making a big, exciting project. in these eight weeks, i will create an mvp of my application, <a href = "https://gmiesner.github.io/sustain/">sustain</a>, but have many ideas for improving it later. </p>
