  <p id = "about-text"> I'm a student at the University of Missouri, majoring in Information Technology, with a certificate in Web and Mobile Applications Development. I am involved with the <a href = "https://mca.missouri.edu/"class = "links"> Mizzou Computing Association</a>, where I helped to rebuild the website as a part of the Web Development Special Interest Group. I also lead the <a href = "https://github.com/MCA-Data-Science" class = "links"> Data Science</a> Special Interest Group, where I help new data scientists learn the neccesary skills to analyze data and create data visualizations with my team.

  I love to create things with code, but how I fell into the wonderful world of technology is a bit atypical. When I was an avid reader in the sixth grade, I wanted to connect with other readers and talk about all the books I was reading. So I created a book blog, where I <i> did</i> connect with other readers and talk about books, but I also began to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ever since then, I have been learning and creating things with code in some capacity, even if the road there has been a little bit bumpy.
