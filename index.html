<h2> who i am </h2> 
<p> as i'm writing this, i have a single day of (virtual; due to the global pandemic) high school left. so i can no longer claim the name 'high schooler'. first and foremost, i am a passionate beyond measure about the world, its problems, its beauties, all the knowledge it contains, and the wonderful people who live on it. i like coding and have been messing around with code since abouth sixth grade. i plan to continue my formal education at missouri s & t, studying computer science. i enjoy learning on my own, creating in whatever media available to me, gobbling up books on every subject under the sun, and helping others. </p>
