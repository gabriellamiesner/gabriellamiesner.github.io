<p style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; " > All Freddy Riley wants is for Laura Dean to stop breaking up with her.

    The day they got together was the best one of Freddy's life, but nothing's made sense since. Laura Dean is popular, funny, and SO CUTE ... but she can be really thoughtless, even mean. Their on-again, off-again relationship has Freddy's head spinning — and Freddy's friends can't understand why she keeps going back.
    
    When Freddy consults the services of a local mystic, the mysterious Seek-Her, she isn't thrilled with the advice she receives. But something's got to give: Freddy's heart is breaking in slow motion, and she may be about to lose her very best friend as well as her last shred of self-respect. Fortunately for Freddy, there are new friends, and the insight of advice columnist Anna Vice, to help her through being a teenager in love.

<h4 style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; " > are prisons obsolete? </h4>
<p style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; "> With her characteristic brilliance, grace and radical audacity, Angela Y. Davis has put the case for the latest abolition movement in American life: the abolition of the prison. As she quite correctly notes, American life is replete with abolition movements, and when they were engaged in these struggles, their chances of success seemed almost unthinkable. For generations of Americans, the abolition of slavery was sheerest illusion. Similarly,the entrenched system of racial segregation seemed to last forever, and generations lived in the midst of the practice, with few predicting its passage from custom. The brutal, exploitative (dare one say lucrative?) convict-lease system that succeeded formal slavery reaped millions to southern jurisdictions (and untold miseries for tens of thousands of men, and women). Few predicted its passing from the American penal landscape. Davis expertly argues how social movements transformed these social, political and cultural institutions, and made such practices untenable.<br><br>summary taken from <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108428.Are_Prisons_Obsolete_" target = "_blank">goodreads</a>. </p>

<h4 style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; " > no one is too small to make a difference</h4>
<p style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; "> No One Is Too Small to Make A Difference brings you Greta in her own words, for the first time. Collecting her speeches that have made history across the globe, from the United Nations to Capitol Hill and mass street protests, her book is a rallying cry for why we must all wake up and fight to protect the living planet, no matter how powerless we feel.

<h4 style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; " > we are the weather: saving the planet begins at breakfast </h4>
<p style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; "> In We Are the Weather, Jonathan Safran Foer explores the central global dilemma of our time in a surprising, deeply personal, and urgent new way. The task of saving the planet will involve a great reckoning with ourselves—with our all-too-human reluctance to sacrifice immediate comfort for the sake of the future. We have, he reveals, turned our planet into a farm for growing animal products, and the consequences are catastrophic. Only collective action will save our home and way of life. And it all starts with what we eat—and don’t eat—for breakfast. <br><br> summary taken from <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43565381-we-are-the-weather" target="_blank">goodreads</a>.   </p>
