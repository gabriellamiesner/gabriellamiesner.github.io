Fortunately for Freddy, there are new friends, and the insight of advice columnist Anna Vice, to help her through being a teenager in love.
    
    Mariko Tamaki and Rosemary Valero-O'Connell bring to life a sweet and spirited tale of young love that asks us to consider what happens when we ditch the toxic relationships we crave to embrace the healthy ones we need.<br><br> summary taken from <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40864841-laura-dean-keeps-breaking-up-with-me" target = "_blank">goodreads</a>.</p>
<h4 style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; " > voting right act of 1965 </h4>
<p style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; "> aimed to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote. the act was signed into law by president johnson in the aftermath of brutality toward the civil rights protesters at the selma to montgomery march. the act banned the use of literacy tests, provided for federal oversight of voter registration in areas where less than 50 percent of the non-white population had not registered to vote, and authorized the U.S. attorney general to investigate the use of poll taxes in state and local elections.</p>
<h4 style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; " > the 24th amendment & poll taxes </h4>
<p style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; "> in 1964, the 24th amendment banned poll taxes in federal elections, however that wasn't the end of poll taxes.  in 1966, poll taxes were made illegal in state elections by a supreme court ruling. however, poll taxes still exist today in sneaky ways, modern poll taxes can take the form of making residents pay to get an id to vote or by making pay for a notary to vote absentee.  </p>
<h4 style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; " > current voter suppression </h4>
<p style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; "> voter suppression is far from over in the us. in fact, in the 2018 midterm elections, voter registration problems, purging registered voters prior to election, strict voter id and ballot laws, voter confusion due to administrative misinformation, voter intimidation and harassment, poll closures, gerrymandering and malfunctioning voting machines were all reported.     </p>
<h4 style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; " > what can i do?</h4>
<p style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; "> talk to your representatives. flood their inboxes and voicemails with demands to end voter suppression in your state. if you are able to vote, vote those who don't uphold voting rights out. pay attention to redistricting when it does happen, especially if you life in an area where gerrymandering is common. also, get involved with organizations, such as the ACLU who are fighting voter suppression.  </p>
<h4 style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; " > voting is a privilege </h4>
<p style = "text-align: left; margin-left:5%; "> however, recognize that voting (even in the us) is an extreme privilege. especially now, with a global pandemic going on, voting will be more unsafe than ever for vulnerable communities. the communities (low income communities and communities of color) most historically affected by voter suppression are also the ones most affected by covid. many states are making absentee voting difficult, which will prevent many people from voting. if you are in a position where you are safe to vote, vote in the interests of those who are not able to and under no circumstance should you shame those who are unable to vote.   </p>
