i was a 2020 [computer science summer institute student](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/), where i learned the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library, completed daily assignments, went through career development workshops, and created a [final project](https://agar-js.glitch.me/) reminiscent of agar.io.
