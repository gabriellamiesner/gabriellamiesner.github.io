<div id = "1"> <h3><strong>chapter one : five foundations of economics</strong> </h3></div>
scarcity: limited nature of society's resources

economics: study of how individuals and societies allocate their limited resources to satisfy their practically unlimited wants

- microeconomics: study of individual units that make up the economy
    - ie houses + businesses
- macroeconomics: study of the overall aspects and workings of an economy, such as inflation, growth, employment, interest rates, and productivity of the economy as a whole
    - big money topics

five foundations of economics

1. incentives : factors that motivate you to act or exert effort
    - positive : encourage action by offering rewards or payments
    - negative : discourage action by providing undesirable consequences or punishments
    - direct : incentive that has a direct effect on people, places, things, etc
    - indirect : incentive that has effects that aren't immediately seen or direct impact
2. trade offs : doing one thing means that you will not have the time, resources, or energy to dod something else
3. opportunity cost : the trade off cost of not doing something or doing something in place of something else
    - key to making good decisions: minimizing your opportunity cost and choosing the option with the largest benefit
    - “Could I be using my time, talents, or energy on another activity that would be even more profitable for me?”
4. marginal thinking : evaluating whether the benefit of one more unit of something is greater than its cost
    - economic thinking: purposeful evaluation of the available opportunities to make the best decision possible
5. trade creates value
    - markets: bring buyers and sellers together to exchange goods and services
    - circular flow diagram: shows how goods, services, and resources flow through the economy via commerce between households and firms
    - trade : voluntary exchange of goods and services between two or more parties
    - comparative advantage : situation in which an individual, business, or country can produce at a lower opportunity cost than a competitor can
    - When goods and jobs are free to move across borders, not everyone benefits equally, nor should we expect this outcome.
    - None of those advantages make the outsourcing of jobs any less painful for affected workers, but outsourcing is an important component of economic growth in the long run.
        - **do the ends justify the means?**

<div id = "2"> <h3><strong>chapter two : model building and gains from trade</strong> </h3></div>

economic models : based upon assumptions to simplify reality ; models help economists understand the key relationships that drive economic decisions

natural experiment: when real-world events meet the criteria of an experiment designed to test a hypothesis

positive statement: can be tested and validated

- description of what is
- usually what economists use

normative statement: cannot be tested or validated

what ought to be

ceteris paribus: process of examining change in one variable while holding everything else constant

- from the latin meaning " other things being equal " or "all else equal"

endogenous: factors we can control

exogenous: factors we can't control

production possibilities frontier: model that illustrates the combinations of outputs a society can produce if all of its resources are being used efficiently

- expands when technology evolves or population increases
- outcome is considered efficient when resources are fully utilized and potential output is maximized.
- only way to get more of a good is to accept less of another
- Because resources are not perfectly adaptable, production does not expand at a constant rate.

law of increasing opportunity cost: the opportunity cost of producing a good rises as a society produces more of it

- significant trade-offs the more of something you produce

economic growth: process that enables a society to produce more output in the future

specialization: limiting of one's work to a particular area

specialization leads to greater output

absolute advantage: when one person can produce more than another with the same quantity of resources

short run: period in which we make decisions that reflect our immediate or short-term wants, needs, or limitations. In the short run, consumers can partially adjust their behavior

long run: period in which we make decisions that reflect our needs, wants, and limitations over a long time horizon. In the long run, consumers have time to fully adjust to market conditions.

consumer good : any good that is produced for present consumption

- food, entertainment, clothing

capital goods: help in the production of other valuable goods and services in the future

- roads, factories, trucks, computers

investment : process of using resources to create or buy new capital
