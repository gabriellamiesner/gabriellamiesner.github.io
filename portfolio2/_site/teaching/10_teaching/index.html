    <h3><strong>chapter notes</strong></h3>
<p><a href="#1">chapter 1</a>
<br />
<a href="#2">chapter 2</a></p>
<div id="1"> <h3><strong>chapter one : five foundations of economics</strong> </h3></div>
<p>scarcity: limited nature of society’s resources</p>

<p>economics: study of how individuals and societies allocate their limited resources to satisfy their practically unlimited wants</p>

<ul>
  <li>microeconomics: study of individual units that make up the economy
    <ul>
      <li>ie houses + businesses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>macroeconomics: study of the overall aspects and workings of an economy, such as inflation, growth, employment, interest rates, and productivity of the economy as a whole
    <ul>
      <li>big money topics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>five foundations of economics</p>

<ol>
  <li>incentives : factors that motivate you to act or exert effort
    <ul>
      <li>positive : encourage action by offering rewards or payments</li>
      <li>negative : discourage action by providing undesirable consequences or punishments</li>
      <li>direct : incentive that has a direct effect on people, places, things, etc</li>
      <li>indirect : incentive that has effects that aren’t immediately seen or direct impact</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>trade offs : doing one thing means that you will not have the time, resources, or energy to dod something else</li>
  <li>opportunity cost : the trade off cost of not doing something or doing something in place of something else
    <ul>
      <li>key to making good decisions: minimizing your opportunity cost and choosing the option with the largest benefit</li>
      <li>“Could I be using my time, talents, or energy on another activity that would be even more profitable for me?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>marginal thinking : evaluating whether the benefit of one more unit of something is greater than its cost
    <ul>
      <li>economic thinking: purposeful evaluation of the available opportunities to make the best decision possible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>trade creates value
    <ul>
      <li>markets: bring buyers and sellers together to exchange goods and services</li>
      <li>circular flow diagram: shows how goods, services, and resources flow through the economy via commerce between households and firms</li>
      <li>trade : voluntary exchange of goods and services between two or more parties</li>
      <li>comparative advantage : situation in which an individual, business, or country can produce at a lower opportunity cost than a competitor can</li>
      <li>When goods and jobs are free to move across borders, not everyone benefits equally, nor should we expect this outcome.</li>
      <li>None of those advantages make the outsourcing of jobs any less painful for affected workers, but outsourcing is an important component of economic growth in the long run.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>do the ends justify the means?</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<div id="2"> <h3><strong>chapter two : model building and gains from trade</strong> </h3></div>

<p>economic models : based upon assumptions to simplify reality ; models help economists understand the key relationships that drive economic decisions</p>

<p>natural experiment: when real-world events meet the criteria of an experiment designed to test a hypothesis</p>

<p>positive statement: can be tested and validated</p>

<ul>
  <li>description of what is</li>
  <li>usually what economists use</li>
</ul>

<p>normative statement: cannot be tested or validated</p>

<p>what ought to be</p>

<p>ceteris paribus: process of examining change in one variable while holding everything else constant</p>

<ul>
  <li>from the latin meaning “ other things being equal “ or “all else equal”</li>
</ul>

<p>endogenous: factors we can control</p>

<p>exogenous: factors we can’t control</p>

<p>production possibilities frontier: model that illustrates the combinations of outputs a society can produce if all of its resources are being used efficiently</p>

<ul>
  <li>expands when technology evolves or population increases</li>
  <li>outcome is considered efficient when resources are fully utilized and potential output is maximized.</li>
  <li>only way to get more of a good is to accept less of another</li>
  <li>Because resources are not perfectly adaptable, production does not expand at a constant rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>law of increasing opportunity cost: the opportunity cost of producing a good rises as a society produces more of it</p>

<ul>
  <li>significant trade-offs the more of something you produce</li>
</ul>

<p>economic growth: process that enables a society to produce more output in the future</p>

<p>specialization: limiting of one’s work to a particular area</p>

<p>specialization leads to greater output</p>

<p>absolute advantage: when one person can produce more than another with the same quantity of resources</p>

<p>short run: period in which we make decisions that reflect our immediate or short-term wants, needs, or limitations. In the short run, consumers can partially adjust their behavior</p>

<p>long run: period in which we make decisions that reflect our needs, wants, and limitations over a long time horizon. In the long run, consumers have time to fully adjust to market conditions.</p>

<p>consumer good : any good that is produced for present consumption</p>

<ul>
  <li>food, entertainment, clothing</li>
</ul>

<p>capital goods: help in the production of other valuable goods and services in the future</p>

<ul>
  <li>roads, factories, trucks, computers</li>
</ul>

<p>investment : process of using resources to create or buy new capital</p>
